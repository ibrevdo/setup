# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.

# igor: this file is sourced when the user is logged in (before startx).
# but after startx, some of the configuration is lost,
# so I moved all config to .bashrc which is sourced every time the terminal emulator of X
# is started.
# the only purpose of this file, is to source .bashrc, when logining into runlevel 3 or
# when connecting to this computer with ssh

#export MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=i965

    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then

# moved to .Xmodmap file
# map CapsLock to the Esc
